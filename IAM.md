# IAM: Users and Groups

+ IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global Service
+ **Root account** created by default, shouldn't used or shared
+ **Users** are ppl within your org, and can be grouped
+ **Group** can't be nested, groups can contain only users.
+ **Users** don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

# IAM: Permissions
+ **Users and Groups** can be assigned JSON documents called **policies**
+ These policies define the permissions of a **user**
+ **least privilege principle**: don't give more permissions than user needs
